# PyGameSpriteGenerator
A simple HTML5 page for generating sprites for PyGame using draw.rect

After trying to make nice sprites using draw.rect, I realised that a sprite generator might be useful.
If you want to use it yourself, please go ahead and download the code.  

If you want to tip me, even a tiny amount for the effort, please do.
